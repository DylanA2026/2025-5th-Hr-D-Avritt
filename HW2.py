#4. Create a variable that asks the user to input an integer.
firstNumber = int(input("First Number: "))
#5. Add the integer variable from #2 with the integer from #4 and print the result.
sum = RandomNumber + firstNumber
print (sum)

   #6. Take the result from #5 and divide it by 2. Print the result.
print (sum / 2)
#7. Change the value of the boolean variable to the opposite value (if true then make false, or vice versa).
IsPersonAwesome = False
#8. Print the value of the boolean variable.
print(IsPersonAwesome)
